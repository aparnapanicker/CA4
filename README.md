Crimes are the punishable violations made by people against law. Several crimes reported each year. Many crimes are being dealt with. In Northern Ireland, the greatest number of crimes are reported in the region of Belfast City. The crime type that is being reported the most is Criminal Damage. One problem that exists across all years from 2001 to 2019 is that, Criminal Damage is not the crime type that is most dealt, even though it is the one which gets recorded the most. It is Violence with Injury and Violence without Injury, that gets dealt the most. From the analysis performed earlier, it is evident that, Criminal Damage is showing a decreasing trend in the recording rate over the years but not showing a decreasing trend in the dealt rate. Also from the statistical tests performed based on the research question: Whether it is not possible to predict the dealt percentage of Criminal Damage based on Calendar Year for the region of Belfast City, it is proven that calendar_year plays a certain role on the dealt percentage of criminal damage crimes reported. Hence this research aims to predict the dealt rate of criminal damage crime recorded based on calendar_year. Thus it helps to identify the factors that need to be improved from the authoritative side for increasing the crime dealt rate. This further helps to increases the rate of recorded crimes that are justified.
